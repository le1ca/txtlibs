As soon as ${name:name} woke up this past ${day:day of the week},
${pronoun:he/she (corresponding to the name you entered)} knew it was going
to be a bad day.

${pronoun:} woke up to ${ppronoun:his/her (corresponding)} ${pet:animal}
dropping a dead ${gift:animal} right on ${ppronoun:} ${body part}. The ${gift:}
was bleeding everywhere and smelled like ${adjective}
${noun - something that smells bad}.

After scolding ${ppronoun:} ${pet:}, ${name:} put the ${gift:} in the trash.
However, the ${pet:} was insistent that ${name:} should appreciate its gift.
Unbeknownst to ${name:}, the ${pet:} got the ${gift:} back out of the trash and
started tearing it to shreds. ${name:} only learned of this upon stepping on its
${adjective} ${bp:body part} in the ${room in house (kitchen, bedroom, ...)}.

${name:} threw away the ${gift:}'s ${bp:} and went on a search for the rest of
it. ${pronoun:} found a ${body part} in the ${room in house}, a ${body part} in
the ${room in house}, and a ${body part} in the ${room in house}. However, the
${lost:body part} was nowhere to be found.

Realizing that ${pronoun:} was late to work, ${name:} forgot all about the
${gift:} and sprinted outside to the car. Speeding to work, ${pronoun:} got
pulled over for speeding -- going ${number} in a ${smaller number}-MPH zone.
The officer also accused ${name:} of being drunk and made ${pronoun:} get out
of the car for a sobriety test, making ${pronoun:} even later. ${pronoun:}
muttered under ${ppronoun:} breath, what a ${insult} ${farm animal}. The cop
overheard ${pronoun:} and wrote ${pronoun:} a ticket for
${present tense transitive verb} the peace.

When ${pronoun:} was almost to work, ${ppronoun:} boss called ${pronoun:}.
"Why aren't you here?" he said. "Uh, it's a long, ${adjective} story," said
${name:}. "Whatever," said ${ppronoun:} boss, "just get here as soon as
possible. The board of directors is waiting for you to give your presentation."

"Oh, ${noun}!" said ${name:}. ${pronoun:} had forgotten all about that.
${pronoun:} hadn't prepared at all, ${pronoun:} had no idea what ${pronoun:}
was going to say. ${name:} finally arrived at work and sprinted up the stairs
to the board room.

"Nice of you to join us," said one of the directors - a ${adjective}
${age  (e.g. young, old, ...)} man with ${hc:color} hair and a ${adjective}
${color} suit.

Not knowing how to respond, ${name:} began ${ppronoun:} presentation.

"The first thing you have to realize about ${product:noun} is that it is capable
of anything," said ${name:}. "Everybody needs a ${product:} even if they don't
know it."

"You can get a ${product:} anywhere, but you really need a ${adjective} one for
it to be effective. Especially if you want to ${transitive verb, base form} a
${noun} or go ${tv:transitive verb, base form} a ${tvn:noun}."

"Stop right there," said the ${hc:}-haired director. "You're telling me your 
${product:} can ${tv:} a ${tvn:}?"

"Uh, sure, why not," said ${name:}. "Here, let me show you." ${name:} reached
into ${ppronoun:} bag and pulled out a ${adjective}, ${adjective} ${product:}
and ${number} ${adjective} ${pn:plural noun}. You just ${tv2:transitive verb}
the ${nw:nonsense word}, then you can ${tv:} anything you want. 

${name:} activated the ${nw:}, but what happened next wasn't what ${name:}
expected.

It didn't ${tv:} the ${pn:} -- instead, it shot a ${gift:}'s ${lost:} right
into the director's ${body part}.
